# Typing-text-animation-Javascript

For the Typing Text Animation project, I employed JavaScript to create a dynamic typing effect. The HTML markup served as the foundation for the animation, CSS was used for styling, and JavaScript added the animation behavior. The text appears as if it's being typed out in real-time, adding a visually engaging touch to the content.
